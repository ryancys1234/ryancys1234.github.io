Welcome! I am a fourth year Data Science Specialist student at the University of Toronto. I am interested in statistical and computational approaches to a variety of topics in human biology, medicine, and public health. Currently I am rather mediocre and my experience is quite limited (rip) but I am trying my best to change that. While also struggling with, uh, everything.

Thank you for visiting, and have a nice day / night!
